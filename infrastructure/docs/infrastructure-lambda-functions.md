```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"ecs:DescribeServices",
				"ecs:DescribeTasks",
				"ecs:ListTasks",
				"ecs:UpdateService"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		},

## Integration with ECS Deployment

These Lambda functions work together to support the ECS Fargate-based application deployment:

1. **Deployment Pipeline**: Orchestrates blue-green deployments to ECS services
2. **Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitors ECS application health
3. **Performance Optimization**: Automatically optimizes service configurations
4. **Security Monitoring**: Monitors ECS services and application security

### **Deployment Workflow**

graph TD
    A[Deployment Trigger] --> B[ECS Service Update]
    B --> C[Health Check Validation]
    C --> D{Health Check Passed?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Traffic Switch]
    D -->|No| F[Rollback]
    E --> G[Performance Monitoring]
    F --> H[Alert Generation]
    G --> I[Optimization Analysis]
    I --> J[Auto-scaling Updates]
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### **CloudWatch Metrics**

Each function publishes custom metrics:

- **Health Check Success Rate**: Percentage of successful health checks
- **Response Time**: Average response time for health checks
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of health check failures
- **Performance Score**: Overall service performance rating

### **Alerting Rules**

```typescript
// Health Check Failure Alert
const healthCheckAlert = new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'HealthCheckFailure', {
	metric: healthCheckMetric,
	threshold: 95, // Alert if success rate drops below 95%
	evaluationPeriods: 2,
	alarmDescription: 'Health check failure rate exceeded threshold',
})
```

## Error Handling & Resilience

### **Retry Logic**

- **Exponential Backoff**: Functions retry failed operations with increasing delays
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures during service outages
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed executions are captured for analysis

### **Fallback Strategies**

- **Graceful Degradation**: Functions continue operating with reduced functionality
- **Default Values**: Use sensible defaults when configuration is unavailable
- **Alert Generation**: Notify operators of critical failures

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Improvements**

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive scaling based on historical patterns
2. **Advanced Monitoring**: Custom dashboards and real-time metrics
3. **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing infrastructure capabilities
4. **Multi-region Support**: Cross-region health monitoring and failover

### **Architecture Evolution**

- **Event-driven Architecture**: Enhanced event processing and routing
- **Microservices**: Function decomposition for better maintainability
- **Serverless Integration**: Enhanced integration with other serverless services
