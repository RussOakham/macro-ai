# Environment Deployment Strategy Overview

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our three-tier deployment strategy, designed to support development workflows
from individual pull requests to production-ready applications. The strategy balances cost consciousness for personal projects
with scalability for enterprise applications.

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture

### 1. Preview/PR Deployment Strategy

**Purpose**: Ephemeral environments for every pull request  
**Cost**: <$0.50/month per environment  
**Duration**: Temporary (PR lifecycle)  
**Target**: Development and testing

#### Key Features

- **Ephemeral Isolation**: Each PR gets a unique `pr-{number}` namespace
- **Full-Stack Deployment**: Both frontend and backend components
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Environment destroyed when PR is closed/merged
- **Change Detection**: Only deploys components that have changed
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized resources for short-term use

#### Infrastructure Components

- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + CloudFront CDN
- **Backend**: ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch

### 2. Staging Deployment Strategy

**Purpose**: Persistent environment for integration testing  
**Cost**: ~£15/month (with scheduled shutdown)  
**Duration**: Persistent with scheduled lifecycle  
**Target**: Pre-production validation

#### Key Features

- **Scheduled Lifecycle**: Automatic shutdown at 6 PM daily
- **On-Demand Deployment**: Manual trigger for immediate access
- **Production-Like Configuration**: Similar to production but cost-optimized
- **Integration Testing**: Full end-to-end testing capabilities
- **Cost Controls**: 75% cost reduction through scheduled shutdown

#### Infrastructure Components

- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + CloudFront CDN
- **Backend**: ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch
- **Scheduling**: Lambda-based shutdown automation

### 3. Production Deployment Strategy

**Purpose**: Live environment serving end users  
**Cost**: £25-300/month (hobby to enterprise scale)  
**Duration**: Persistent  
**Target**: End users and revenue generation

#### Hobby Scale (Personal Projects)

**Cost**: ~£25/month  
**Target**: <100 users, personal projects

##### Key Features

- **Production Security**: AWS WAF protection
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized for personal use
- **Reliability**: Single-AZ deployment
- **Monitoring**: Basic CloudWatch monitoring

##### Infrastructure Components

- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + CloudFront CDN
- **Backend**: ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Cache**: Upstash Redis
- **Security**: AWS WAF
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch

#### Enterprise Scale (Revenue-Generating Applications)

**Cost**: ~£200/month  
**Target**: 500+ users, revenue-generating applications

##### Key Features

- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation
- **Enterprise Security**: WAF + Shield DDoS protection
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability
- **Database Redundancy**: RDS with read replicas

##### Infrastructure Components

- **Frontend**: AWS Amplify + CloudFront CDN
- **Backend**: ECS Fargate (Multi-AZ) with Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache**: ElastiCache Redis cluster
- **Security**: AWS WAF + Shield
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + enhanced observability
- **Auto-Scaling**: Application Auto Scaling

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Environment             | Monthly Cost | Target Users | Use Case           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Preview/PR              | <$0.50       | N/A          | Development        |
| Staging                 | ~£15         | N/A          | Testing            |
| Production (Hobby)      | ~£25         | <100         | Personal projects  |
| Production (Enterprise) | ~£200        | 500+         | Revenue-generating |

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

### Development Flow

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branch
2. **Preview Deployment**: Automatic PR environment creation
3. **Code Review**: Review in isolated preview environment
4. **Merge to Develop**: Automatic staging deployment
5. **Staging Validation**: Integration testing and validation
6. **Production Release**: Manual promotion to production

### Change Detection & Optimization

All environments support intelligent change detection:

- **Backend Changes**: Only deploy ECS Fargate service
- **Frontend Changes**: Only deploy Amplify application
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Deploy CDK stack
- **Shared Changes**: Full deployment required

## 🚀 Scaling Path

### Phase 1: Hobby Scale (Current)

- Single-AZ deployment
- Neon PostgreSQL for cost efficiency
- Basic monitoring and security
- Suitable for personal projects

### Phase 2: Enhanced Hobby Scale

- Improved monitoring and alerting
- Enhanced security features
- Better performance optimization
- Target: 100-500 users

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale

- Multi-AZ high availability
- RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Advanced security and compliance
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Target: 500+ users, revenue-generating

### Phase 4: Advanced Enterprise (Future)

- Multi-region deployment
- Edge computing with Lambda@Edge
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- SOC 2 and GDPR compliance
- Target: Enterprise customers
