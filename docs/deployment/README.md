# Deployment Documentation

This section covers deployment strategies, infrastructure setup, CI/CD pipelines, and production environment
management for the Macro AI application.

## üöÄ Deployment Overview

Macro AI is designed for deployment on AWS infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive
monitoring, and scalable architecture patterns.

## üìö Deployment Documentation

  - Automated testing and quality checks
  - Build and deployment workflows
  - Environment promotion strategies
  - Rollback procedures
  - Security scanning and compliance

- **[Monitoring & Logging](./monitoring-logging.md)** - Observability and maintenance
  - Application monitoring with CloudWatch
  - Log aggregation and analysis
  - Performance metrics and alerting
  - Error tracking and debugging
  - Health checks and uptime monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Architecture

### AWS Services

- **Compute**: ECS Fargate for containerized applications
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for user management
- **Storage**: S3 for static assets and backups
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- **Security**: IAM roles and security groups

### Environment Strategy

```mermaid
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production

   Local      AWS Test   AWS Prod
```

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

### Automated Deployment

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes to feature branch
2. **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and quality checks
3. **Build**: Docker image creation and registry push
4. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to staging
5. **Testing**: Integration and smoke tests
6. **Production**: Manual approval for production deployment

### Manual Deployment Steps (Legacy - Being Migrated)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: These deployment commands are being migrated from Lambda to EC2.
> New deployment procedures will be available once the migration is complete.

```bash
# Build production images
pnpm build

# Deploy to staging (legacy - being migrated to EC2)
# pnpm deploy:staging

# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# Deploy to production (legacy - being migrated to EC2)
# pnpm deploy:production
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Production Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security header configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- **Network Security**: VPC, security groups, and NACLs

### Compliance & Monitoring

- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging
- **Audit Trails**: User action tracking and compliance
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated database and configuration backups

## üìä Performance & Scaling

### Performance Optimization

- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling and query optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session and application caching
- **CDN Integration**: CloudFront for static asset delivery
- **Image Optimization**: Automated image compression and delivery

### Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling groups for compute resources
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with health checks
- **Resource Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and auto-scaling triggers

## üîß Environment Management

### Configuration Management

- **Environment Variables**: Centralized configuration management
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime feature toggling
- **Database Migrations**: Automated schema updates
- **Configuration Validation**: Zod schema validation in production

### Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Local development with Docker Compose
- **Staging**: AWS environment mirroring production
- **Production**: High-availability AWS deployment
- **Testing**: Isolated environment for integration testing
