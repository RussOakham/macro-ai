### Shared Patterns

- **Go-Style Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all features
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer separation
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with runtime validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all features
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Auto-generated documentation and clients

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Patterns

### Feature Development Guidelines

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Features organized by business domain
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction for testability
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic separation from controllers
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Zod schemas for all data boundaries
5. **Error Handling**: Go-style error tuples throughout

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: Feature interaction testing
- **Mock Strategies**: Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types in all tests
- **Coverage Goals**: 90%+ test coverage for all features
