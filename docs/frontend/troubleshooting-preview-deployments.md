# Troubleshooting Frontend Preview Deployments

Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for the frontend preview deployment system.

## 🚨 Quick Diagnosis

### Deployment Status Check

**Step 1: Check GitHub Actions**

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Find the "Deploy Frontend Preview" workflow run
3. Look for red ❌ (failed), yellow 🟡 (in progress), or green ✅ (success)

**Step 2: Check PR Comments**

1. Look for automated comments on your PR
2. Check for error messages or status updates
3. Note any warning messages about backend discovery

**Step 3: Check Preview URL**

1. Try accessing the preview URL from the PR comment
2. Check browser developer tools for console errors
3. Test API calls and network requests

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Deployment Workflow Failures

#### Issue: "Deploy Frontend Preview" Workflow Fails

**Symptoms**:

- Red ❌ on the workflow check
- Error messages in GitHub Actions logs
- No preview URL generated

**Diagnosis Steps**:

```bash
# Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
# Look for specific error messages in these steps:
# - Validate Access
# - Discover Backend Environment
# - Generate Environment Configuration
# - Build React Application
# - Deploy to Amplify
```

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

**A. Access Validation Failure**

```text
Error: PR author does not have write access
```

**Solution**: Ensure you have write access to the repository or ask a maintainer to trigger the deployment.

**B. AWS Credentials Issue**

```text
Error: Unable to locate credentials
```

**Solution**:

- Check that AWS IAM role is properly configured
- Verify OIDC trust relationship is set up correctly
- Ensure `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret is configured

**C. Build Failure**

```text
Error: Build failed with exit code 1
```

**Solution**:

```bash
# Test build locally first
cd apps/client-ui
pnpm install
pnpm type-check  # Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm lint        # Check for linting errors
pnpm build       # Test the build process
```

**D. Amplify Deployment Failure**

```text
Error: Failed to create Amplify app
```

**Solution**:

- Check AWS Amplify service limits
- Verify IAM permissions for Amplify operations
- Check for naming conflicts with existing apps

### 2. Backend Discovery Issues

#### Issue: Backend Not Found, Using Fallback

**Symptoms**:

- Warning message: "No backend found - will use fallback API URL"
- API calls may fail or return unexpected data
- Preview works but with limited functionality

**Diagnosis Steps**:

```bash
# Test backend discovery locally
cd apps/client-ui
./scripts/backend-discovery-service.sh discover pr-123 --pr-number 123 --debug

# Check for available backend stacks
./scripts/backend-discovery-service.sh list-stacks
```

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

**A. Backend Stack Doesn't Exist**

```text
No CloudFormation stack found for PR 123
```

**Solution**:

- Deploy the backend for your PR first
- Use the full-stack deployment workflow
- Or continue with fallback API for frontend-only changes

**B. Backend Stack in Wrong State**

```text
Stack exists but status is CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
```

**Solution**: Wait for backend deployment to complete before deploying frontend.

**C. Stack Naming Mismatch**

```text
Expected MacroAiPr123Stack but found MacroAi-PR-123-Stack
```

**Solution**: Update the stack naming patterns in `env-mapping.json` or ensure consistent naming.

### 3. Environment Variable Issues

#### Issue: API Calls Failing in Preview

**Symptoms**:

- Frontend loads but API calls return 404 or CORS errors
- Console errors about failed network requests
- Authentication failures

**Diagnosis Steps**:

```bash
# Check the build info endpoint
curl https://pr123.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/build-info.json

# Test API endpoint directly
curl https://api-pr123.example.com/api/health

# Check environment variables in deployment logs
# Look for "Environment Configuration Summary" section
```

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

**A. Wrong API Endpoint**

```json
{
	"api_url": "https://api-development.macro-ai.com/api",
	"resolution_method": "fallback_url"
}
```

**Solution**:

- Verify backend stack exists and is accessible
- Check CloudFormation stack outputs for correct API endpoint
- Manually override API endpoint if needed

**B. Missing API Key**

```text
Error: API key not configured
```

**Solution**:

- Verify `FRONTEND_API_KEY` secret is configured in repository
- Check that the secret value is correct and not expired
- Ensure the API key has appropriate permissions

**C. CORS Issues**

```text
Access to fetch at 'https://api.example.com' from origin 'https://pr123.amplifyapp.com' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution**:

- Ensure backend CORS configuration includes preview domains
- Check if backend allows `*.amplifyapp.com` origins
- Verify API endpoint is accessible from browser

### 4. Preview URL Issues

#### Issue: Preview URL Returns 404 or Blank Page

**Symptoms**:

- Preview URL shows "Page Not Found" or blank page
- Browser developer tools show 404 errors
- Preview worked before but now broken

**Diagnosis Steps**:

```bash
# Check if Amplify app exists
aws amplify list-apps --query 'apps[?contains(name, `pr-123`)]'

# Check deployment status
aws amplify list-jobs --app-id YOUR_APP_ID --branch-name main

# Test different paths
curl -I https://pr123.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/
curl -I https://pr123.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/index.html
```

**Common Causes & Solutions**:

**A. DNS Propagation Delay**

```text
DNS resolution failed for pr123.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com
```

**Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation, then try again.

**B. Amplify App Deleted**

```text
App not found or has been deleted
```

**Solution**:

- Check if someone manually deleted the app
- Redeploy using the manual workflow
- Check cleanup workflows for premature deletion

**C. Build Artifacts Missing**

```text
Index.html not found in deployment
```

**Solution**:

- Check build logs for successful completion
- Verify `dist` directory is created and contains files
- Check Amplify configuration for correct `baseDirectory`

### 5. Performance Issues

#### Issue: Slow Preview Loading

**Symptoms**:

- Preview takes a long time to load
- Large bundle sizes
- Poor performance metrics

**Diagnosis Steps**:

```bash
# Check bundle size
cd apps/client-ui
pnpm build
du -sh dist/

# Analyze bundle
pnpm build:analyze  # if available

# Check network tab in browser developer tools
```

**Solutions**:

- Enable code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and assets
- Check for unnecessary dependencies
- Use production build optimizations

### 6. Cache Issues

#### Issue: Old Content Showing in Preview

**Symptoms**:

- Preview shows old version despite new deployment
- Changes not reflected in preview
- Stale API responses

**Solutions**:

**A. Browser Cache**

```bash
# Hard refresh
Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# Clear browser cache
# Or use incognito/private browsing mode
```

**B. CDN Cache**

```bash
# Check cache headers
curl -I https://pr123.d1234567890.amplifyapp.com/

# Wait for cache TTL to expire (usually 5-15 minutes)
```

## 🌐 Troubleshooting CORS in Preview Deployments

CORS issues are common in cross-origin preview setups (Amplify frontend → API Gateway/Lambda backend).
Below are targeted checks and fixes.

### 1) Origin mismatch (exact URL matching required)

Symptoms:

- Browser error: "has been blocked by CORS policy"
- Response/status may be 200/204 but missing or wrong Access-Control-Allow-Origin

What to check:

- The exact Amplify preview URL must be present in the backend allowlist.
  Wildcards like \*.amplifyapp.com are not used when credentials are enabled.
- Compare the printed origins in the update-backend-cors job with your Amplify URL.

Fix:

- Ensure CI sets CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include the exact preview origin.
- Re-run the Deploy Preview workflow or push a new commit to retrigger.

Verification:

```bash
# Replace APP_URL and API_URL
curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "${API_URL%/}/health" \
  -H "Origin: ${APP_URL%/}" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" | \
  grep -i "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${APP_URL%/}"
```

### 2) Trailing slash mismatches (frontend vs backend URLs)

Symptoms:

- OPTIONS succeeds locally, but fails in CI or browser
- ACAO header missing when Origin ends with a slash

What to check:

- Normalize both APP_URL and API_URL without trailing slash before comparison and usage.

Fix:

- In scripts and manual checks, strip trailing slashes: ${VAR%/}
- Our CI already does this in the verification step; mirror that locally.

Verification:

```bash
APP_URL="${APP_URL%/}"; API_URL="${API_URL%/}"
curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "$API_URL/health" \
  -H "Origin: $APP_URL" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" | grep -i "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: $APP_URL"
```

### 3) Browser caching of preflight responses

Symptoms:

- You fixed CORS config but browser still shows CORS errors
- Incognito works but normal session fails

What to check:

- Browsers cache successful preflights for the Access-Control-Max-Age duration.

Fix:

- Hard refresh the page or open DevTools Network tab and disable cache while DevTools is open.
- Use a new private/incognito window.
- Optionally change request headers (e.g., add a temporary X-Debug header) to force a fresh preflight.

Verification:

```bash
# Use curl to bypass browser cache and check headers
curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "${API_URL%/}/health" \
  -H "Origin: ${APP_URL%/}" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" | \
  grep -Ei "Access-Control-Allow-Origin|Access-Control-Max-Age"
```

### 4) Timing/propagation delays after CORS update

Symptoms:

- CI shows CORS updated, but browser still fails for a few minutes

What to check:

- API Gateway and CloudFront can take a short time to reflect updates.

Fix:

- Wait 2–5 minutes and retry.
- Confirm the CI step "Verify CORS preflight and GET" passed in the deploy-preview workflow.

Verification:

```bash
# Quick loop to re-check every 10s up to 2 minutes
for i in {1..12}; do
  if curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "${API_URL%/}/health" \
    -H "Origin: ${APP_URL%/}" \
    -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" | \
    grep -qi "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${APP_URL%/}"; then
    echo "CORS OK"; break; fi; echo "retry..."; sleep 10; done
```

### 5) Verify CORS end-to-end

We can validate both preflight and actual request behavior.

Steps:

1. Preflight: OPTIONS request returns ACAO matching the Amplify origin
2. Simple GET: GET /health returns ACAO matching the Amplify origin

Commands:

```bash
# Preflight
curl -s -i -X OPTIONS "${API_URL%/}/health" \
  -H "Origin: ${APP_URL%/}" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"

# GET
curl -s -i "${API_URL%/}/health" -H "Origin: ${APP_URL%/}"
```

Notes:

- Our /health endpoint uses permissive CORS (origin: true, credentials: false) to ease diagnostics.
- Application endpoints use the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS allowlist with credentials enabled; an exact origin match is required.

**C. Build Cache**

```bash
# Force rebuild without cache
# Use manual workflow with "force-rebuild: true"
```
