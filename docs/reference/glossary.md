## Current Implementation Status ‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY

This glossary provides definitions for terms, concepts, and technologies used throughout the Macro AI application
and documentation. All terms reflect the **current production implementation** and established patterns.

## üî§ A-Z Terms

### A

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**
: A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Used to track the reasoning behind technical choices in the Macro AI project.

**API Client**
: Auto-generated TypeScript client library that provides type-safe access to the Macro AI API endpoints. Generated from OpenAPI specifications using Zodios.

**API Key Authentication**
: Alternative authentication method using X-API-KEY header for programmatic access and service-to-service communication.

**AWS Cognito**
: Amazon Web Services identity and access management service used for user authentication, registration, and session management in Macro AI.

### B

**Bearer Token**
: JWT token used for API authentication, typically passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer {token}".

### C

**Chat Vector**
: Vector embedding representation of chat messages stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for semantic search capabilities.

**Cookie Authentication**
: Primary authentication method using HttpOnly cookies to store JWT tokens securely in the browser.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
: Web security feature that allows the frontend application to make requests to the API from different origins.

### D

**Drizzle ORM**
: TypeScript ORM used for database operations, providing type-safe queries and schema management with PostgreSQL.

### E

**Embedding**
: Vector representation of text content generated by OpenAI models, stored as 1536-dimensional vectors for semantic search.

**Environment Configuration**
: System for managing application settings through environment variables with Zod validation and type safety.

### F

**Frontend**
: React-based client application built with Vite, TanStack Router, and Tailwind CSS for the user interface.

### G

**Go-style Error Handling**
: Error handling pattern using Result tuples `[data, error]` instead of try/catch blocks, providing explicit error management.

### H

**HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**
: Index algorithm used by pgvector for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search in vector embeddings.

**HttpOnly Cookie**
: Secure cookie that cannot be accessed by JavaScript, used to store authentication tokens safely.

### I

**Incident Response**
: Systematic approach to handling system outages, performance issues, and other operational problems with defined severity levels and procedures.

### J

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
: Compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting authentication information between parties.

### L

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
: AI model like OpenAI's GPT that powers the chat functionality in Macro AI.

### M

**Monorepo**
: Repository structure containing multiple related packages and applications managed with pnpm workspaces and TurboRepo.

**MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**
: Average time required to restore service after an incident, tracked as a key operational metric.

### O

**OpenAPI**
: Specification format used to describe REST APIs, automatically generated from Zod schemas in Macro AI.

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
: Programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems, implemented using Drizzle ORM.

### P

**pgvector**
: PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities for storing and querying embeddings.

**pnpm**
: Package manager used for dependency management and workspace organization in the monorepo.

### R

**Rate Limiting**
: Technique to control the number of requests a client can make to the API within a specific time window.

**Refresh Token**
: Long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication.

**Result Tuple**
: Error handling pattern returning `[data, error]` where exactly one value is null, enabling explicit error checking.

### S

**Semantic Search**
: Search technique using vector embeddings to find content based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

**Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
: Web standard for streaming real-time data from server to client, used for AI response streaming.

**Shadcn/ui**
: Component library providing pre-built, customizable UI components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

### T

**TanStack Query**
: Data fetching and caching library for React applications, providing server state management.

**TanStack Router**
: Type-safe router for React applications with file-based routing and automatic code splitting.

**Trunk-based Development**
: Version control strategy where developers work on short-lived branches that merge frequently to main.

**TurboRepo**
: Build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, providing efficient caching and parallel execution.

**Type Safety**
: Programming approach ensuring type correctness at compile time, extensively used throughout the TypeScript codebase.

### V

**Vector Database**
: Database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors, implemented using PostgreSQL + pgvector.

**Vite**
: Build tool and development server for modern web applications, used for the React frontend.

**Vitest**
: Testing framework for Vite projects, used for unit and integration testing throughout the monorepo.

### Z

**Zod**
: TypeScript-first schema validation library used for runtime type checking and OpenAPI generation.

**Zodios**
: API client library that provides end-to-end type safety by combining Zod schemas with Axios HTTP client.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Terms

**API Gateway**
: Entry point for all client requests to backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and routing.

**Microservices**
: Architectural pattern where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled services.

**Service Layer**
: Application layer containing business logic and coordinating between controllers and data access layers.

**Repository Pattern**
: Design pattern that encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing data.

## üîß Development Terms

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
: Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying code changes using GitHub Actions.

**Code Generation**
: Automated creation of code from specifications, used for API clients and database schemas.

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
: Development feature that updates modules in the browser without full page reload.

**Linting**
: Static code analysis to identify and fix code quality issues using ESLint and Prettier.

**Migration**
: Database schema change script that modifies the database structure while preserving data.

## üöÄ Deployment Terms

**Blue-Green Deployment**
: Deployment strategy using two identical production environments to minimize downtime.

**Container**
: Lightweight, portable package containing application code and dependencies.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
: Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, planned using AWS CDK.

**Load Balancer**
: System that distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances.

## üìä Monitoring Terms

**Observability**
: Ability to understand system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces.

**SLA (Service Level Agreement)**
: Commitment to specific performance and availability standards.

**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**
: Quantitative measure of service performance.

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**
: Target value for service level indicators.

## üîê Security Terms

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
: Attack that tricks users into executing unwanted actions, prevented using SameSite cookies.

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
: Security vulnerability allowing injection of malicious scripts, prevented using HttpOnly cookies.

**OWASP**
: Open Web Application Security Project providing security best practices and guidelines.

**Zero Trust**
: Security model requiring verification for every user and device accessing resources.
