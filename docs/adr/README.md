# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural and technical decisions
made during the development of the Macro AI application.

## üìã What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and
consequences. They help teams understand why certain technical choices were made and provide historical context for
future decisions.

## üìö Current ADRs

### Core Architecture Decisions

- **[001: Error Handling Strategy](./001-error-handling-strategy.md)** - Go-style error handling approach
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted (Implemented)
  - **Decision**: Use custom tryCatch utilities instead of traditional try/catch or neverthrow
  - **Context**: Need for consistent, type-safe error handling with automatic logging
  - **Consequences**: Improved error handling consistency, type safety, and zero external dependencies

- **[002: Authentication Approach](./002-authentication-approach.md)** - AWS Cognito integration decision
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted (Implemented)
  - **Decision**: Use AWS Cognito for user authentication and management
  - **Context**: Need for secure, scalable authentication solution
  - **Consequences**: Reduced authentication complexity, improved security

- **[003: Database Technology](./003-database-technology.md)** - PostgreSQL and pgvector choice
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted (Implemented)
  - **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for data storage
  - **Context**: Need for relational data with vector similarity search
  - **Consequences**: Unified database solution with AI capabilities

- **[004: API Client Generation](./004-api-client-generation.md)** - OpenAPI auto-generation strategy
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted (Implemented)
  - **Decision**: Auto-generate TypeScript clients from OpenAPI specifications
  - **Context**: Need for type-safe, maintainable API integration
  - **Consequences**: Improved type safety and reduced maintenance overhead

## üìù ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this template structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were evaluated and why were they not chosen?

## References

Links to relevant discussions, documentation, or external resources.
```

## üîÑ ADR Process

### Creating New ADRs

1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Draft ADR**: Create draft using the template above
3. **Team Review**: Discuss with team members and stakeholders
4. **Refine**: Incorporate feedback and finalize decision
5. **Accept**: Mark as accepted and implement decision
6. **Communicate**: Share decision with relevant teams

### ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Initial draft under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended but still in use
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a newer ADR

## üéØ Decision Categories

### Technical Architecture

- Database technology choices
- Framework and library selections
- Integration patterns and approaches
- Performance and scalability strategies

### Development Process

- Code organization and structure
- Testing strategies and frameworks
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation approaches

### Infrastructure & Operations

- Deployment strategies
- Monitoring and observability
- Security implementations
- CI/CD pipeline decisions

## üìä Decision Impact Assessment

### High Impact Decisions

Decisions that affect:

- Core system architecture
- Development workflow
- Security model
- Performance characteristics
- Long-term maintainability

### Medium Impact Decisions

Decisions that affect:

- Feature implementation patterns
- Tool and library choices
- Code organization
- Testing approaches

### Low Impact Decisions

Decisions that affect:

- Coding conventions
- Documentation formats
- Development environment setup
- Minor tool selections

## üîó Related Documentation

- **[Architecture](../architecture/README.md)** - Current system architecture
- **[Development](../development/README.md)** - Development guidelines influenced by ADRs
- **[Features](../features/README.md)** - Feature implementations based on ADR decisions
- **[Operations](../operations/README.md)** - Operational procedures influenced by ADRs

## üìà ADR Benefits

### For Current Development

- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent approaches across the codebase
- **Context**: Provides reasoning behind technical choices
- **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand architectural decisions
- **Quality**: Encourages thoughtful decision-making process

### For Future Development

- **Historical Context**: Preserves reasoning for future reference
- **Evolution**: Enables informed evolution of architectural decisions
- **Learning**: Captures lessons learned from previous decisions
- **Accountability**: Documents who made decisions and when

## üéØ Best Practices

### Writing Effective ADRs

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state the decision and its scope
- **Provide Context**: Explain the problem or opportunity
- **Consider Alternatives**: Document options that were considered
- **Assess Impact**: Clearly state consequences and trade-offs
- **Keep Updated**: Revise status as decisions evolve

### ADR Maintenance

- **Regular Review**: Periodically review ADRs for relevance
- **Update Status**: Keep status current as decisions evolve
- **Link Related ADRs**: Cross-reference related decisions
- **Archive Obsolete**: Mark superseded ADRs appropriately
