# Implementation Plans

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains detailed development timelines and coordination documentation for the Macro AI application. We
maintain implementation plans to ensure effective project management, resource coordination, and milestone tracking
across all development initiatives.

## ðŸ“š Implementation Planning Documentation

### Templates and Guidelines

- **[Implementation Plan Template](./template.md)** - Standardized template for creating implementation plans

### Active Implementation Plans

- **[Q1 2025 Roadmap](./q1-2025-roadmap.md)** - Quarterly development planning and milestone coordination
- **[Chat V2 Implementation](./chat-v2-implementation.md)** - Detailed plan for chat system enhancements

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Implementation plans provide detailed development coordination, timeline management, and resource allocation guidance to
ensure successful delivery of product features while maintaining quality and meeting stakeholder expectations.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan Components

Each implementation plan should include:

- **Scope and Objectives** - Clear definition of deliverables and success criteria
- **Timeline and Milestones** - Detailed development schedule with key checkpoints
- **Resource Requirements** - Team capacity and skill requirements
- **Dependencies and Risks** - External dependencies and potential blockers
- **Quality Assurance** - Testing and validation approach

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[PRD Documentation](../../requirements/prds/README.md)** - Product requirements driving implementation
- **[Technical Designs](../../requirements/technical-designs/README.md)** - Technical approach for implementation
- **[Release Planning](../release-planning/README.md)** - Release coordination for implementations
- **[Development Guidelines](../../../development/README.md)** - Development workflow integration
- **[Testing Strategy](../../../development/testing-strategy.md)** - Quality assurance approach

## ðŸš€ Implementation Planning Process

### Plan Development

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Extract implementation requirements from PRDs and technical designs
2. **Timeline Estimation** - Develop realistic schedules based on complexity and dependencies
3. **Resource Planning** - Align implementation with team capacity and skill availability
4. **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential blockers and develop mitigation strategies
5. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Coordinate plans with product, engineering, and business teams

### Execution Coordination

- Implementation plans should integrate with sprint planning and development workflows
- Regular progress reviews ensure plans remain aligned with execution reality
- Plan updates should be communicated to all stakeholders and reflected in related documentation
- Completed implementations should be analyzed for lessons learned and process improvement
