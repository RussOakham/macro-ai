# Technical Design Template

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document provides a standardized template for creating technical design documents in the Macro AI application. We
maintain this template to ensure consistency and completeness across all technical design documentation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The technical design template establishes a consistent structure for documenting technical approaches, ensuring all
necessary implementation details, architectural considerations, and risk assessments are captured and communicated
effectively.
