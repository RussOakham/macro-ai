# Technical Design Documents

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains technical design documents that bridge product requirements and implementation details for the
Macro AI application. We maintain these documents to ensure complex features have clear technical approaches and
architectural considerations.

## ðŸ“š Technical Design Documentation

### Templates and Guidelines

- **[Technical Design Template](./template.md)** - Standardized template for creating technical design documents

### Active Technical Designs

- **[Streaming Optimization](./streaming-optimization.md)** - Performance improvements for AI response streaming
- **[Vector Search Enhancement](./vector-search-enhancement.md)** - Advanced semantic search capabilities using pgvector

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Technical design documents provide detailed implementation guidance for complex features, ensuring alignment between
product requirements and technical architecture while identifying potential challenges and solutions early in the
development process.

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Design Components

Each technical design should include:

- **Problem Statement** - Technical challenges and requirements
- **Proposed Solution** - High-level technical approach and architecture
- **Implementation Details** - Specific technical specifications and considerations
- **Dependencies and Risks** - External dependencies and potential implementation risks
- **Testing Strategy** - Approach for validating technical implementation

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[PRD Documentation](../prds/README.md)** - Product requirements driving technical designs
- **[System Architecture](../../../architecture/system-architecture.md)** - Overall system context for designs
- **[ADR Documentation](../../../adr/README.md)** - Architectural decisions supporting designs
- **[Implementation Plans](../../planning/implementation-plans/README.md)** - Development coordination for designs
- **[Technology Stack](../../../architecture/technology-stack.md)** - Technical constraints and capabilities

## ðŸš€ Technical Design Process

### Design Development

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Extract technical requirements from PRDs and user stories
2. **Architecture Review** - Ensure alignment with system architecture and existing ADRs
3. **Solution Design** - Develop detailed technical approach and implementation plan
4. **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
5. **Review and Approval** - Technical review by engineering leadership and architecture team

### Implementation Integration

- Technical designs should inform implementation planning and sprint coordination
- Designs may trigger new ADRs for significant architectural decisions
- Implementation learnings should be captured and fed back into design documentation
- Completed designs serve as reference for future enhancements and maintenance
