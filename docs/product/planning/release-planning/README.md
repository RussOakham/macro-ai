# Release Planning Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains release coordination and scheduling documentation for the Macro AI application. We maintain
release planning documentation to ensure effective coordination between development, deployment, and communication
activities.

## ðŸ“š Release Planning Documentation

### Core Planning Documents

- **[Release Calendar](./release-calendar.md)** - Planned release schedule and milestone coordination
- **[Release Templates](./release-templates/README.md)** - Standardized templates for release communication

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Release planning documentation provides coordination between development completion, deployment scheduling, and
stakeholder communication, ensuring smooth release execution and effective user communication.

## ðŸ“‹ Release Planning Components

Release planning should include:

- **Release Schedule** - Planned release dates and milestone coordination
- **Feature Coordination** - Alignment between feature completion and release timing
- **Communication Planning** - Stakeholder and user communication coordination
- **Risk Assessment** - Potential release risks and mitigation strategies
- **Rollback Planning** - Quick rollback procedures if issues arise

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[Implementation Plans](../implementation-plans/README.md)** - Development coordination for release features
- **[Feature Flags](../feature-flags/README.md)** - Gradual rollout coordination with releases
- **[Release Process](../../../operations/release-process.md)** - Operational release procedures
- **[Release Notes](../../communication/release-notes/README.md)** - User-facing release communication
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](../../../deployment/ci-cd-pipeline.md)** - Automated deployment coordination

## ðŸš€ Release Planning Process

### Planning Lifecycle

1. **Feature Completion Assessment** - Evaluate development progress against release timeline
2. **Release Scheduling** - Coordinate release timing with development and business priorities
3. **Communication Planning** - Prepare stakeholder and user communication materials
4. **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential release risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Execution Coordination** - Coordinate release activities across all teams

### Release Integration

- Release planning should align with implementation plans and feature completion
- Release schedules should integrate with operational procedures and deployment automation
- Release communication should be coordinated with stakeholder updates and user feedback
- Release outcomes should inform future planning and process improvement
