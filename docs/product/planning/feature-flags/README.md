# Feature Flags Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains feature flag strategies and rollout coordination documentation for the Macro AI application. We
maintain feature flag documentation to ensure safe, gradual deployment of new features with proper testing and rollback
capabilities.

## ðŸ“š Feature Flags Documentation

### Strategy and Guidelines

- **[Feature Flag Strategy](./strategy.md)** - Overall approach to feature flag implementation and management
- **[Current Feature Flags](./current-flags.md)** - Active feature flags tracking and status

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Feature flag documentation provides guidance for safe feature deployment, enabling gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and
quick rollback capabilities while minimizing risk to user experience and system stability.

## ðŸ“‹ Feature Flag Components

Feature flag documentation should include:

- **Flag Definition** - Clear description of feature and flag purpose
- **Rollout Strategy** - Gradual deployment approach and user targeting
- **Success Criteria** - Metrics for evaluating flag performance
- **Rollback Plan** - Quick rollback procedures if issues arise
- **Timeline** - Expected flag lifecycle and removal schedule

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[Implementation Plans](../implementation-plans/README.md)** - Development coordination for flagged features
- **[Release Planning](../release-planning/README.md)** - Release coordination with feature flags
- **[Success Metrics](../../strategy/success-metrics.md)** - Measurement criteria for flag evaluation
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](../../../deployment/ci-cd-pipeline.md)** - Deployment integration with feature flags
- **[Monitoring & Logging](../../../deployment/monitoring-logging.md)** - Flag performance monitoring

## ðŸš€ Feature Flag Process

### Flag Lifecycle

1. **Flag Planning** - Define flag strategy during feature development planning
2. **Implementation** - Integrate flags into feature development and deployment
3. **Rollout** - Gradual deployment with monitoring and evaluation
4. **Evaluation** - Assess flag performance against success criteria
5. **Cleanup** - Remove flags after successful full deployment

### Flag Management

- Feature flags should be documented before implementation begins
- Flag status should be regularly reviewed and updated
- Successful flags should be removed promptly to reduce technical debt
- Failed flags should be analyzed for lessons learned and process improvement
