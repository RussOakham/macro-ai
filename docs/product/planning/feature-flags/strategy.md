# Feature Flag Strategy

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document outlines the overall approach to feature flag implementation and management for the Macro AI application.
We maintain this strategy to ensure consistent, safe deployment of new features with proper testing and rollback
capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The feature flag strategy provides guidelines for implementing gradual feature rollouts, enabling safe deployment, A/B
testing capabilities, and quick rollback procedures while minimizing risk to user experience and system stability.
