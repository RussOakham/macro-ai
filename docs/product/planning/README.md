# Planning Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains implementation planning and coordination documentation for the Macro AI application, including
development timelines, feature rollout strategies, and release coordination. We maintain these documents to ensure
effective project management and cross-functional alignment.

## ðŸ“š Planning Documentation

### Core Planning Documents

- **[Implementation Plans](./implementation-plans/README.md)** - Detailed development timelines and coordination
- **[Feature Flags](./feature-flags/README.md)** - Gradual rollout and testing strategies
- **[Release Planning](./release-planning/README.md)** - Release coordination and scheduling

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Planning documentation serves as the operational bridge between product requirements and development execution,
providing:

- Detailed development timelines and milestone coordination
- Risk management and dependency tracking
- Feature rollout strategies and testing approaches
- Release coordination and communication planning

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[Requirements Documentation](../requirements/README.md)** - Product requirements driving planning
- **[Release Process](../../operations/release-process.md)** - Operational release procedures
- **[Development Guidelines](../../development/README.md)** - Development workflow integration
- **[Merge Strategy](../../operations/merge-strategy.md)** - Code integration approach
- **[CI/CD Pipeline](../../deployment/ci-cd-pipeline.md)** - Automated deployment coordination

## ðŸš€ Planning Process

### Planning Lifecycle

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Extract planning requirements from PRDs and technical designs
2. **Timeline Development** - Create detailed development schedules with dependencies
3. **Resource Coordination** - Align planning with team capacity and priorities
4. **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies
5. **Stakeholder Communication** - Share plans and coordinate cross-functional alignment

### Planning Integration

- Implementation plans should align with sprint planning and development workflows
- Feature flag strategies should integrate with deployment and testing processes
- Release planning should coordinate with operational procedures and communication
- Planning documents should be updated based on execution learnings and changes
