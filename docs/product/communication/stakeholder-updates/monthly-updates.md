# Monthly Updates Template

## Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è IN_DEVELOPMENT

This document provides the comprehensive template for regular progress reports and metrics updates for stakeholders of
the Macro AI application, including multi-model chat functionality and response sources progress reporting. We maintain
monthly updates to ensure consistent communication about strategic initiative progress, performance metrics, and
competitive positioning.

## üéØ Purpose

Monthly updates provide regular, comprehensive communication about product development progress, strategic milestone
achievement, and competitive positioning, ensuring stakeholders have current information for decision-making and
strategic planning. We use these updates to communicate progress on our multi-model and response sources initiatives
that establish our competitive differentiation.
