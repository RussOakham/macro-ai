# Feature Requests

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document compiles community and user-requested features and enhancements for the Macro AI application. We maintain
feature request documentation to track user-driven improvement suggestions and evaluate them against product strategy
and technical feasibility.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Feature requests provide direct insight into user needs and desired capabilities, helping prioritize development efforts
based on user value while ensuring requested features align with strategic product direction and technical constraints.
