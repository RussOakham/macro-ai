# Product Management Documentation

## Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

This section provides comprehensive product management documentation for the Macro AI application, including
strategic planning, requirements management, implementation coordination, and stakeholder communication. We have
completed a full product management framework covering our strategic multi-model chat and response sources
initiatives that establish our competitive differentiation in the AI assistance market.

## üéØ Purpose

The product management documentation serves as the central hub for product strategy, feature planning,
and cross-functional coordination. We maintain this documentation to ensure alignment between product
vision, technical implementation, and business objectives while supporting effective communication
across all stakeholders. This framework enables data-driven decision making and strategic execution
of our multi-model AI platform and research-grade source attribution capabilities.
