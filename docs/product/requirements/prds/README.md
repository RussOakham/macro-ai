# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains Product Requirements Documents for major features and enhancements in the Macro AI application. We
maintain PRDs to provide comprehensive specifications that guide feature development from conception to delivery.

## ðŸ“š PRD Documentation

### Templates and Guidelines

- **[PRD Template](./template.md)** - Standardized template for creating new PRDs

### Active PRDs

- **[Chat Enhancements V2](./chat-enhancements-v2.md)** - Advanced chat system improvements and AI capabilities
- **[User Dashboard](./user-dashboard.md)** - Comprehensive user management and profile features

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

PRDs serve as the definitive specification for product features, providing detailed requirements, success criteria, and
implementation guidance to ensure alignment between product vision and technical delivery.

## ðŸ“‹ PRD Components

Each PRD should include:

- **Problem Statement** - User problems and business context
- **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes and acceptance criteria
- **User Stories** - Detailed user requirements and scenarios
- **Technical Considerations** - Implementation constraints and dependencies
- **Timeline and Milestones** - Development phases and delivery expectations

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[Product Roadmap](../../strategy/product-roadmap.md)** - Strategic context for PRD prioritization
- **[User Stories](../user-stories/README.md)** - Detailed user requirements from PRDs
- **[Technical Designs](../technical-designs/README.md)** - Implementation designs for PRD features
- **[Implementation Plans](../../planning/implementation-plans/README.md)** - Development coordination for PRDs
- **[Feature Documentation](../../../features/README.md)** - Current implementation status

## ðŸš€ PRD Process

### Creation Process

1. **Strategic Alignment** - Validate PRD against product roadmap and user personas
2. **Stakeholder Input** - Gather requirements from product, engineering, and design teams
3. **Technical Feasibility** - Review implementation approach with development teams
4. **Success Criteria** - Define measurable outcomes and acceptance criteria
5. **Approval and Communication** - Finalize PRD and communicate to all stakeholders

### Maintenance

- PRDs should be updated based on implementation learnings and user feedback
- Regular reviews ensure PRDs remain aligned with strategic priorities
- Completed PRDs serve as reference for post-release analysis and future enhancements
