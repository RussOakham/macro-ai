# User Stories Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains user stories and acceptance criteria for the Macro AI application, organized by feature domain. We
maintain user stories to ensure development is focused on user value and to provide clear acceptance criteria for
feature validation.

## ðŸ“š User Stories Documentation

### Templates and Guidelines

- **[User Story Template](./template.md)** - Standardized template for creating user stories

### Feature-Based User Stories

- **[Authentication](./authentication.md)** - User stories for authentication and account management
- **[Chat System](./chat-system.md)** - User stories for AI chat interactions and conversation management
- **[Multi-Model Functionality](./multi-model-functionality.md)** - User stories for multi-model AI selection and optimization
- **[User Management](./user-management.md)** - User stories for profile management and user preferences

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

User stories translate product requirements into user-focused scenarios with clear acceptance criteria, ensuring
development teams understand the user value and can validate feature completion effectively.

## ðŸ“‹ User Story Format

Each user story follows the standard format:

- **As a** [user type]
- **I want** [functionality]
- **So that** [benefit/value]
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, testable conditions for completion

## ðŸš€ User Story Process

### Story Development

1. **PRD Analysis** - Extract user requirements from Product Requirements Documents
2. **Persona Alignment** - Ensure stories reflect target user needs and behaviors
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Define specific, testable conditions for story completion
4. **Priority Assignment** - Rank stories based on user value and technical dependencies
5. **Development Coordination** - Integrate stories into sprint planning and implementation

### Story Validation

- Acceptance criteria should be testable and measurable
- Stories should be reviewed by development teams for technical feasibility
- Completed stories should be validated against acceptance criteria
- User feedback should inform story refinement and future development
