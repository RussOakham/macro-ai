# User Story Template

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document provides a standardized template for creating user stories in the Macro AI application. We maintain this
template to ensure consistency in user story format and to guide the creation of clear, testable acceptance criteria.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The user story template establishes a consistent structure for documenting user requirements, ensuring all stories
include necessary context, clear value propositions, and specific acceptance criteria for validation.
