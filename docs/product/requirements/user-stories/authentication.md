# Authentication User Stories

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document contains user stories for authentication and account management features in the Macro AI application. We
maintain these stories to ensure authentication flows are user-centered and provide clear acceptance criteria for
security and usability validation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Authentication user stories define the user experience for account creation, login, security management, and account
recovery, ensuring we provide secure and intuitive authentication flows that meet user expectations.
