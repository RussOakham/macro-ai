# Requirements Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains comprehensive requirements documentation for the Macro AI application, including Product
Requirements Documents, user stories, and technical design specifications. We maintain these documents to ensure clear
communication between product vision and technical implementation.

## ðŸ“š Requirements Documentation

### Core Requirements Documents

- **[PRDs](./prds/README.md)** - Product Requirements Documents for major features and enhancements
- **[User Stories](./user-stories/README.md)** - User-focused requirements with acceptance criteria
- **[Technical Designs](./technical-designs/README.md)** - Technical design documents bridging product and implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Requirements documentation serves as the bridge between product strategy and technical implementation, providing:

- Clear feature specifications and success criteria
- User-centered requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical design guidance for development teams
- Traceability from user needs to implementation details

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation

- **[Product Strategy](../strategy/README.md)** - Strategic context for requirements
- **[Feature Documentation](../../features/README.md)** - Implementation details for requirements
- **[Implementation Plans](../planning/implementation-plans/README.md)** - Development coordination for requirements
- **[ADR Documentation](../../adr/README.md)** - Architectural decisions supporting requirements
- **[Testing Strategy](../../development/testing-strategy.md)** - Quality assurance for requirements

## ðŸš€ Requirements Process

### Document Lifecycle

1. **PRD Creation** - Product requirements defined based on strategic priorities
2. **User Story Development** - Requirements broken down into user-focused stories
3. **Technical Design** - Implementation approach designed for complex requirements
4. **Implementation Planning** - Development coordination and timeline estimation
5. **Acceptance Testing** - Validation against defined criteria

### Review and Approval

- PRDs require product and engineering leadership approval
- User stories should be reviewed by development teams for feasibility
- Technical designs need architectural review and ADR consideration
- All requirements documents should be updated based on implementation learnings
