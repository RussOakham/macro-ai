# Streaming Optimization Technical Design

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This technical design document outlines performance improvements for AI response streaming in the Macro AI application.
We are developing these optimizations to enhance user experience through faster response times and more efficient
resource utilization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The streaming optimization design addresses performance bottlenecks in the current AI response streaming implementation,
providing technical solutions for improved throughput, reduced latency, and better resource management while maintaining
response quality.
