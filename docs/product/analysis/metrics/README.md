# Metrics Analysis Documentation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This section contains product metrics and KPI tracking documentation for the Macro AI application. We maintain metrics
analysis documentation to provide ongoing visibility into product performance and support data-driven decision making.

## ðŸ“š Metrics Analysis Documentation

### Core Metrics Documents

- **[Dashboard Metrics](./dashboard-metrics.md)** - Key performance indicators and primary metrics tracking
- **[User Engagement](./user-engagement.md)** - User behavior analysis and engagement patterns
- **[Technical Metrics](./technical-metrics.md)** - Performance and reliability metrics analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Metrics analysis provides ongoing visibility into product performance, user behavior, and system health, enabling
proactive decision making and continuous optimization of product features and user experience.

## ðŸ“‹ Metrics Analysis Components

Metrics analysis should include:

- **Performance Tracking** - Systematic monitoring of key performance indicators
- **Trend Analysis** - Pattern identification and performance trend evaluation
- **Comparative Analysis** - Performance benchmarking and goal assessment
- **Actionable Insights** - Data-driven recommendations for improvement
- **Regular Reporting** - Consistent metrics communication to stakeholders

## ðŸ”— Related Documentation
