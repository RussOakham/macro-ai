# User Engagement Metrics

## Status: ⚠️ IN_DEVELOPMENT

This document provides comprehensive user behavior analysis and engagement patterns for the Macro AI application,
including multi-model usage patterns, response sources interaction tracking, and advanced user satisfaction
measurement. We maintain these metrics to understand how users interact with our strategic features and identify
opportunities for improving user experience and retention.

## 🎯 Purpose

User engagement metrics provide deep insights into user behavior patterns, feature adoption, and satisfaction levels
across our multi-model chat functionality and response sources features. We use these metrics to optimize user
experience, identify opportunities for increased user value, and measure the success of our strategic initiatives in
establishing competitive differentiation.
