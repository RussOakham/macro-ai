# Dashboard Metrics

## Status: âœ… ACTIVE

This document defines the comprehensive dashboard metrics framework for the Macro AI application, including multi-model
usage tracking, response sources engagement measurement, and strategic success indicators. We maintain these metrics to
provide real-time visibility into product performance and support data-driven decision making across all strategic
initiatives.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Dashboard metrics provide centralized tracking of the most critical product performance indicators, enabling quick
assessment of product health, user satisfaction, and business objectives. We use these metrics to monitor the success
of our multi-model chat functionality and response sources features while supporting strategic decision making and
competitive positioning.
