# User Personas

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

This document defines the target user profiles and behavior patterns for the Macro AI application. We maintain these
personas to ensure product decisions are grounded in user needs and to guide feature development priorities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

User personas provide a shared understanding of our target users, their goals, pain points, and behavior patterns,
enabling us to make user-centered product decisions and validate feature concepts against real user needs.
