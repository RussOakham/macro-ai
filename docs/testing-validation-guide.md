# Go to: AWS Console → Billing → Budgets
# Verify: Staging and production budgets exist
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] Cost alerts are active
- [ ] Cost Explorer shows expected services

### Step 9.2: Resource Usage Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze resource utilization and costs

```bash
# 1. Check ECS resource usage
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster MacroAiStagingStack \
  --services MacroAiStagingStack \
  --query 'services[0].{runningCount:runningCount,desiredCount:desiredCount}'

# 2. Monitor CloudWatch billing metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 86400 \
  --statistics Maximum

# 3. Generate cost report
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] Resource usage is within expected ranges
- [ ] Cost trends are monitored
- [ ] Budget alerts are functioning
- [ ] Cost optimization features are active

## 🔒 Phase 10: Security & Compliance Validation

### Step 10.1: Access Control Validation

**Objective**: Verify security access controls

```bash
# 1. Check IAM role permissions
aws iam list-attached-role-policies \
  --role-name GitHubActions-DeployRole

# 2. Verify least privilege principle
# Ensure roles have minimal required permissions

# 3. Test secret access
aws secretsmanager list-secrets

# 4. Verify encryption at rest
aws kms list-keys
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] IAM roles have least privilege
- [ ] Secrets are properly encrypted
- [ ] No excessive permissions
- [ ] Encryption is enabled everywhere

### Step 10.2: Network Security Validation

**Objective**: Test network security configuration

```bash
# 1. Check security groups
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --filters Name=group-name,Values='*MacroAi*'

# 2. Verify VPC configuration
aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
  --filters Name=tag:Name,Values='*MacroAi*'

# 3. Check ALB security
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
  --names MacroAiStagingStack
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] Security groups are restrictive
- [ ] No public access to sensitive resources
- [ ] ALB has proper SSL configuration
- [ ] Network isolation is maintained

---

## 📋 Phase 11: Final Validation & Sign-Off

### Step 11.1: Integration Testing

**Objective**: Test end-to-end functionality

```bash
# 1. Test complete user journey
# - User registration
# - Authentication
# - Feature usage
# - Data persistence

# 2. Test cross-service communication
# - API to database
# - API to external services
# - Frontend to API

# 3. Test error handling
# - Invalid requests
# - Network failures
# - Database timeouts
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] End-to-end user flows work
- [ ] Cross-service communication functions
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Data consistency is maintained

### Step 11.2: Performance Benchmarking

**Objective**: Establish performance baselines

```bash
# 1. Run performance tests
hey -n 1000 -c 10 https://staging-api.yourdomain.com/api/features

# 2. Monitor response times
# Check CloudWatch metrics for p95, p99 response times

# 3. Test concurrent users
# Simulate realistic user load patterns

# 4. Document performance baselines
# Record: Response times, throughput, error rates
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Response times are acceptable
- [ ] System handles expected load
- [ ] Baselines are documented

### Step 11.3: Documentation & Handover

**Objective**: Complete documentation and knowledge transfer

```bash
# 1. Update runbooks
# Document all validated procedures

# 2. Create troubleshooting guides
# Common issues and resolutions

# 3. Update monitoring dashboards
# Add any missing metrics or alerts

# 4. Conduct knowledge transfer session
# Train team on new procedures
```

**✅ Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] All procedures are documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides exist
- [ ] Monitoring is comprehensive
- [ ] Team is trained on procedures
