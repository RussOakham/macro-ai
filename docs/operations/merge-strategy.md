# Trunk-Based Merge Strategy

## Current Implementation Status ‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY

This document outlines the trunk-based development workflow for the Macro AI project, including branch naming
conventions, pull request requirements, review processes, and continuous integration workflows. The merge strategy
is **fully implemented and enforced** through GitHub branch protection rules and automated workflows.

## üå≥ Trunk-Based Development Overview

### Development Philosophy ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Core Principles**:

- **Single Main Branch**: All development flows through the `main` branch
- **Short-Lived Feature Branches**: Feature branches exist for days, not weeks
- **Continuous Integration**: Every commit triggers automated testing
- **Small, Frequent Commits**: Encourage small, focused changes
- **Fast Feedback Loops**: Quick validation and integration cycles

### Branch Strategy

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch feature/user-auth
    checkout feature/user-auth
    commit id: "Add auth"
    commit id: "Add tests"
    checkout main
    merge feature/user-auth
    commit id: "Deploy v1.1"
    branch feature/chat-ui
    checkout feature/chat-ui
    commit id: "Chat UI"
    checkout main
    merge feature/chat-ui
    commit id: "Deploy v1.2"
    branch hotfix/security-fix
    checkout hotfix/security-fix
    commit id: "Security fix"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix/security-fix
    commit id: "Deploy v1.2.1"
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Branch Naming Conventions

5. **Security**: Are there any security implications?

**Review Etiquette**:

- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements

- Focus on the code, not the person

#### For Authors

**Before Requesting Review**:

1. Self-review your own code
2. Ensure all automated checks pass
3. Add comprehensive PR description
4. Include testing evidence
5. Update documentation if needed

**Responding to Feedback**:

- Address all feedback points
- Ask for clarification if needed
- Push new commits to address issues
- Re-request review after changes

```

#### Release Notes Generation

```yaml
- name: Generate Release Notes
  uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
  with:
    config-name: release-drafter.yml
    publish: true
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

#### 1. Start New Work

```bash
# Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Make changes and commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial feature implementation"
```

#### 2. Keep Branch Updated

```bash
# Regularly sync with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/new-feature-name
git rebase main

# Or merge if rebase is complex
git merge main
```

#### 3. Prepare for Review

```bash
# Final sync and cleanup
git rebase -i main  # Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git push origin feature/new-feature-name

# Create pull request with proper labels and description
```

#### 4. Address Review Feedback

```bash
# Make requested changes
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name

# Re-request review
```

#### 5. Post-Merge Cleanup

```bash
# After PR is merged
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/new-feature-name  # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/new-feature-name  # Delete remote branch
```

### Best Practices ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

#### Commit Guidelines

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Clear Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages
3. **Frequent Commits**: Commit early and often
4. **Test Before Commit**: Ensure tests pass before committing

#### Branch Management

1. **Short-Lived Branches**: Keep feature branches small and focused
2. **Regular Updates**: Sync with main frequently to avoid conflicts
3. **Clean History**: Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history
4. **Delete Merged Branches**: Clean up branches after merging

#### Collaboration

1. **Communicate Changes**: Discuss significant changes with team
2. **Pair Programming**: Use pair programming for complex features
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document decisions and share knowledge
4. **Code Reviews**: Participate actively in code review process
