# Operations Documentation

This section covers operational procedures, workflows, and processes for maintaining and managing the Macro AI
application in production.

## üîß Operations Overview

Our operations approach emphasizes **trunk-based development**, **automated processes**, **comprehensive
monitoring**, and **rapid incident response**. We maintain high availability while ensuring code quality and
deployment safety.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Trunk-Based Development

```bash
main branch (trunk)
    ‚Üì
feature/short-lived-branch
    ‚Üì
Pull Request ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
    ‚Üì
Automated CI/CD ‚Üí Deploy
```

### Daily Operations

1. **Morning Standup**: Team sync and planning
2. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and quality checks
3. **Code Reviews**: Peer review of all changes
4. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging/production
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous system health monitoring

## üöÄ Release Management

### Release Cycle

- **Sprint Planning**: 2-week development cycles
- **Feature Development**: Continuous integration with trunk
- **Release Preparation**: Testing and validation
- **Production Deployment**: Automated with manual approval gates
- **Post-Release Monitoring**: Health checks and performance validation

### Version Management

```bash
Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 1.2.3)
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features (backward compatible)
- Patch: Bug fixes and minor improvements
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Gates

- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage requirement
- **Linting and Formatting**: Automated code quality checks
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and performance validation

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline validation
2. **Peer Review**: Code review by team members
3. **Testing Validation**: Manual testing of new features
4. **Security Review**: Security implications assessment
5. **Documentation Update**: Ensure documentation is current

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### System Monitoring

- **Application Health**: Uptime and response time monitoring
- **Database Performance**: Query performance and connection health
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Error Tracking**: Application error monitoring and alerting
- **User Experience**: Frontend performance and user journey tracking

### Alert Management

- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate response required (< 15 minutes)
- **Warning Alerts**: Investigation required (< 1 hour)
- **Info Alerts**: Monitoring and trend analysis
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for unresolved issues

## üîß Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance

- **Weekly**: Dependency updates and security patches
- **Monthly**: Performance review and optimization
- **Quarterly**: Architecture review and technical debt assessment
- **Annually**: Disaster recovery testing and security audit

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Incident Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Initial Response**: Immediate assessment and triage
3. **Escalation**: Team notification and resource allocation
4. **Resolution**: Fix implementation and validation
5. **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis and improvement planning
