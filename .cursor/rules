# MCP Tool Usage Rules for Macro AI Project

## Core Principles

- Always use MCP tools proactively instead of re-implementing functionality
- Maintain context across conversations through memory management
- Structure all complex work through Task Orchestrator
- Reference documentation for best practices before implementation
- Maintain security-first approach with regular scans

## Memory Management Workflow

- Store context after completing tasks, making architectural decisions, or when context becomes complex
- Create entities for project decisions, technical approaches, configuration details, and error resolutions
- Start each new conversation by reading relevant memory to restore project context
- Search for relevant entities and restore project context automatically

## Task Analysis Workflow

- Use sequential thinking to break down complex requests into structured implementation plans
- Create features or tasks in Task Orchestrator for any multi-step work
- Break down into subtasks with clear dependencies and apply appropriate templates
- Include requirements, technical approach, testing strategies, and implementation workflows

## Documentation Reference Strategy

- Search AWS documentation for service-specific best practices before implementing solutions
- Use Ref tool to find relevant code patterns and examples
- Reference official documentation for implementation guidance
- Validate implementations against AWS service best practices, security guidelines, and performance recommendations

## Security Review Integration

- Run Semgrep scans after significant code changes and review security findings
- Create security review tasks in Task Orchestrator and document security decisions
- Scan new code before suggesting it and flag potential security issues proactively
- Reference security best practices from documentation and maintain security-first approach

## Proactive Usage Triggers

- Complex multi-step requests
- Technical architecture questions
- Security-related implementations
- Long-running projects or conversations
- When context becomes complex
- After completing significant work
- Before starting new major tasks
- When switching between different project areas
